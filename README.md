## **Description**



You are asked to complete the following tasks :

- In InterviewTest.UI/Views/Students create a StudentsView.cshtml and provide the code needed to display all the students in a table (every record should have a first name, last name, average of that student's grades and a column for buttons)
- Fill in the "GetAllStudentsWithGradesAsync" method in InterviewTestExercise.Domain/Services/StudentsService.cs so it retrieves the required data about the students and their grades
- When the "database" is empty display the sentence: "No records in the database", add that condition in InterviewTest.UI/Views/Students/StudentsView.cshtml
- In InterviewTestExercise.Domain/Services/StudentsService.cs add a method that will return an average grade of the given student
- For each record implement a button that enables giving new grades, add your code in InterviewTest.UI/Views/Students/StudentsView.cshtml and its page model
- In InterviewTestExercise.Domain/Services/StudentsService.cs add a method that will enable adding a new grade


If you have enough time, write a unit test (not obligatory)
